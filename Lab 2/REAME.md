## Part 1: MNIST Digit Classification
We will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Our classes are the digits 0-9.

## Part 2: Debiasing Facial Detection Systems
We'll explore two prominent aspects of applied deep learning: facial detection and algorithmic bias.
