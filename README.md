# Deep Learning MIT Course 2020 Lab Components

This repository contains codes of software labs for MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning!

## MIT Deep Learning package

You might notice that inside the labs we install the 'mitdeeplearning' python package from the Python Package repository:

>>> !pip install mitdeeplearning

This package contains convienence functions that we use throughout the course and can be imported like any other Python package.

>>> import mitdeeplearning as mdl

We do this for you in each of the labs, but the package is also open source under the same license so you can also use it outside the class.
